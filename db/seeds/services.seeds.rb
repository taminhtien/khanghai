      content: 'Criminal law deals with offences against the social order. Under the common law jurisdiction, crimes disturb the sovereign and it is up to the agents of the sovereign to prosecute those offenders. Criminal law is different from civil law. The main objective of criminal law is deterrence and punishment, while that of civil law is compensation. Criminal offences contain two different elements that determine the extent of the offence â€“ the physical act and the mental state in which the act was done. The criminal law also allows the defences to defend their acts to bring about lesser or negate their criminal responsibility and specifies the punishment appropriate for the criminal act. Criminal law does not need a victim or the consent of the victim to be prosecuted as an offender. Criminal law has been set up to regulate the behaviour of individuals and groups so that they follow the social norms. If you think you have been falsely accused of a criminal act, you might need the services of a competent and professional criminal lawyer to help you out. Since criminal laws can be quite complicated and complex, it is best to hire an experienced lawyer to ensure that the case goes in your favour.'

Under the law, a person can file bankruptcy if they are unable to pay their dues in any way.

Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy law can be used by people who have the resources to pay off their debts in about 3-5 years, but not immediately. The debts of the person are not eliminated and instead they get additional time to pay off their debts. The creditors too need to comply with the rules and provide additional time for them. Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy law is the most common type of bankruptcy where the court declare the debtor to be bankrupt and all his or her assets and all properties are sold off. The money collected is then distributed among the creditors to settle their claims. This is good option for people, who have no hope of paying off their debts in any other way. It is mandatory for the debtors to pass a means test and go through counselling service before they file for bankruptcy under the bankruptcy law. The test and the counselling results are then used by the court to decide the chapter of the bankruptcy code that will work best for the situation.'

Family law is very different from other branches of law as it involves private matters. Mostly the family lawyers act as mediators and negotiators. The court too acts as a mediator and tries to reconcile members of the family to solve their issues among themselves while preserving their relationship. The law provides a structured process that allows the parties involved to resolve their disputes amicably rather than through costly lengthy litigation process that can go on for years. Modern family lawyers discourage families from going to the court as the court decision can have a win-lose outlook and can take years to solve the issue. In collaborative family law, mediated by an experienced lawyer, disputes are settled amicably so that everyone wins something. It not only helps families to stay together, but also is less stressful for the family lawyers. It results in speedy resolution of disputes within the family without going to the court.'
